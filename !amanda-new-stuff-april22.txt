**New objects:

health_pickup
	A health restore item. It is a little white medkit with a red cross. Upon contact with the player, it heals them for 50 HP and despawns. If the player's health goes above 100, it is reset to 100. If the player's health is already at 100 when they touch the item, it despawns and a sound plays - the player stays at full health.

health_pickup_max
	A health restore item. It is a little blue-ish medkit with a yellow cross. Upon contact with the player, it heals them for 75 HP and despawns. If the player's health goes above 100, it is reset to 100. If the player's health is already at 100 when they touch the item, it despawns and a sound plays - the player stays at full health.


hurtbox_test
	An item for testing health restore items. It is a little white medkit with a purple cross. Upon contact with the player, it plays a sound, hurts them for 50 HP, and despawns. They will not die no matter how low their health goes.

**Changes to existing:

	enforce_world_object_spawner has a change in its Create event - one line of code at the very bottom initializes the item_spawn_count variable and sets it to 0. 
	There's also a couple new events here: Press F5 and Press F6. Press F5 runs code that uses a switch-case on item_spawn_count to create health items. Adding more cases to Press F5 allows you to spawn any items you want in a predictable pattern. Pressing F6 just spawns hurtboxes.
